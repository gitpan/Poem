NAME
    Poem - Don't let Perl stand in poets' way!

SYNOPSIS
      use Poem;
      Just Another Perl Poet
      no Poem; # get back to work

DESCRIPTION
    This module practically make perl accept any poem in any language. Yes,
    I mean any language. It even accepts poems in Unicode!

  Options
    Without import options, it prints your poem.

      use Poem;
      There are more than one way to Do it. -- Larry Wall
      no Poem;

    -review
      But you can let perl review your poem via "-review".

        use Poem qw/-review/;
        There are more than one way to Do it. -- Larry Wall
        no Poem;

    -strict
      With this option stricture will apply.

        # this works
        use Poem qw/-review/;
        $Perl = "Practical Extractaction and Report Language";
        no Poem;

        # but not under stricture
        use Poem qw/-review -strict/;
        $Perl = "Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister";
        no Poem;

    -deparse
      If you don't grok your own poem, let perl deparse it.

        # Let perl deparse it
        use Poem qw/-review -deparse/;
        Just Another Perl Poet
        no Poem;

    -act
      If you are an activist rather an a poet, this optin is for you.

        # Who said talk is cheap?
        use Poem qw/-review -act/;
        Just Another Perl Poet
        no Poem;

    -utf8
      Even if your poem is written in non-ascii, Poem works. But if you want
      perl to review it, you probably need this option as well. See
      t/unicode.pl to find out what I mean.

    -quiet
      This is a no-op. Consider that a poet's way of saying "=pod" - "=cut"

        use Poem -quiet;
        Just Another Perl Poet
        no Poem;

  EXPORT
    None by default.
